## Tech Goal ( Mobile First Principle)
This webiste has adopted the Mobile-View Principle which we serve mobile view as our primary concern. The styling is done by Tailwind CSS (JIT Mode) which means that it won't have so much overhead file and it can reduce the css file size. 

## Data 
We fetched the movie data from the TMDB api and used server-side rendering to improve the visit experience.
